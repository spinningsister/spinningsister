Starting in June 2024, DENATURED is printed zine released under spinning sister, celebrating the various talents of artists from Exeter and beyond. We aim to provide a platform for artists of any level to have a published version of their work, available to buy at an affordable price. We have features and interviews from both new and upcoming acts as well as well established musicians, and articles and art pieces covering a wide variety of topics and themes. There is really nothing off limits for content that we will publish, allowing contributors to share their work uncensored. The segment 'CHOICE CUTS' highlights some of our favourite songs at spinning sister, and a playlist compiling the picks from all of the issues can be found <a style = "font-weight:normal" target = "_blank" href = "https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0ZEvPOoHv5urnjis3TiUy4?si=FxM-sfJ4QCGOTZXjeoj-Bg">here</a>. Below is a collection of the covers from previous issues.
