<p>The Boys Want Cars, formed in August 2025, is the solo project of Matt Norris, previously the bassist for Kurtz. Currently, there are two songs released on Bandcamp (Slashing Tyres & Break Out), with a 5-track EP (Healthy & Hurt) set to release on major streaming services on October 18th. The EP is primarily inspired by 90s indie bands including Teenage Fanclub and Ride.</p>

<p>Bramwell are a 4-piece group, originally from Exeter, now based in Cardiff, that blends the power pop sensibilities of sixties British Invasion acts with the earthy weirdness of The La’s and Guided by Voices. This is musik for anorak pop mods, odds and sods. Formed in Torquay at the end of 2021 by Tom Grogan and Avalon Vowles initially to play covers of and songs inspired by the first Beatles LP, they quickly developed their sound to include influences like The Fall and XTC. It was at this point schoolmate Sol Drury joined on drums to record their first string of singles and an EP that released in 2023. Second guitarist Murphy Tandy joined the ranks and their live sound was complete. In 2025, Bramwell released the single ‘Problems’ which gained them a new batch of fans.</p>

<p>Cocodamol is a shoegaze/dreampop duo formed in 2023 between August Shaw and George Gravell. They released their first single “Threnody” shortly after forming, featuring their big wash of sound. They followed their single release with a handful of live shows with an ensemble cast of musicians joining them onstage for a few one off shows, as well as stripped back performances with just the main duo. They have released 3 singles in total, the follow up to Threnody being “Bedroom” which featured a cover of The Shangri-Las “Out In The Streets” as the b-side. The next single "Curiosity" came along some months later, a song that had become a live favourite within the shows. A planned E.P. is to be released in 2025 which will feature many of the songs seen in their live show.</p>

<p>Please excuse the profanity. CUNTRY began in earnest September 2024, after being a recurring joke between friends Niall Ivie (vocals) and Arlo Reynolds (bass, vox). They were joined by Tom Grogan (drums) and Avalon Vowles (percussion, harmonica) of Bramwell fame, and have been joined by Sophia Hurst (fiddle) on occasion for performances. The band are yet to record any music in the studio, but can be heard on the spinning sister compilation tape 'At The Intersection Of Two Back Alleys'. Despite the name, the band take more influence from rockabillyy/psychobilly and hardcore, and songs often have queer themes (cowboy on cowboy love, etc.).</p>

<p>The band behind SPSI001, Kurtz, formed out of the ashes of the great Cheese Masochist in September 2023, consisting of 17 year olds Jake Fox, Jamie Dunne, Matt “Cleveland” Norris and David Percival. During the first half of 2024, you’d be hard pressed to find a Cavern gig where they hadn’t wangled themselves onto the bill. During this time, they wrote and recorded 2 EPs: the spinning sister released self-titled 6 track debut, a rather noisy affair with screaming vocals and abrasive guitars that all 4 members have since sworn off as “immature” and “rubbish”; and the more pop centric second EP “Rustbelt, or, Put your money where your mouth is: meet me at Fingle Bridge and make me evergreen - make me whole - because I can't stand the thought of leaving”, which didn’t make it as a spinning sister release due to financial constraints at the time. The opening track, Fingle Bridge, had an accompanying music video that can be found on the spinning sister YouTube page. On the 28th of December 2024, Kurtz played their last ever show. Though they had a habit of referring to gigs as “the last ever show” in order to sell tickets, it seemed that on this occasion, the boy who cried wolf told no lie. Though the band are inactive, bassist Matt Norris can be heard in his home recordings under the name “The Boys Want Cars” and vocalist Jamie Dunne can be heard in similarly vehicular bands pushbike, where he plays bass and The Motorcycles, where he does guitar, vocals, etc.</p>

<a target = "_blank" style = "font-family:times; font-size:40px; font-weight:normal" href = "https://maeries.bandcamp.com/album/bones">maeries</a>

<p>maeries is a band of changing members, formed around spinning sister co-founder Niall Ivie. Their minimal approach to guitar music can be heard on debut mini-LP 'bones', recorded on a mono cassette tape recorder. The low fidelity sound takes inspiration from the likes of Guided by Voices and early deathcrash demos, but musically the band is more similar to caroline. 'bones' featured additional violin and vocals from Sophia Hurst, with future releases set to have additions from the likes of Stanley Upton. The band are yet to make a live performance.</p>

<p>The Maisonettes are a DIY queer band from Exeter, playing together since 2021 writing lyrics about feminism, body issues and current topics. They formed whilst the four original members were all living together, quickly recording their debut single and then E.P. which was released in February 2021. Since then they have had a few lineup changes and played many shows around the UK with classic punk bands such as Buzzcocks, Sham 69 and Melt Banana, as well as more current bands like Destroy Boys, Grandmas House, CLT DRP and more. Their latest single “Loose Ends” was released in January 2024 and shows the band leaning towards more of brash hardcore sound akin to their live shows. Their upcoming E.P. is set to be recorded soon with a more mature and well crafted sound whilst still providing their usual hooks.</p>

<p>The Motorcycles/Thee Speeding Motorcycles/Them Motorcycles/The Motorcycle Marigold Hotel is the new group spearheaded by SPISI mainstay Jamie Dunne. With no releases just yet, you’ll have to see them live to hear Jamie’s scrappy guitar playing and primitive pop melodies set to the backdrop of a rhythm section currently made up of bass virtuoso Nigel Ivie and George “Captain Caveman” Gravell banging away on a 3 part Mo Tucker drum kit. The crude thudding of the drums and bare, scratchy guitars combined with musical references from Chris Spedding to David Kilgour come together to create music that sounds like what you’d get if The Shaggs had come from Dunedin. Shambolic in every sense of the word, The Motorcycles are a perfect antidote to the Windmill Wannabes still beating the dead horse of “crank wave”/“post punk” that you’ll find littered across the country today.</p>

<p>In 1983, kiwi Josef K. Peterson and Glasgow-born Paul Pot had an idea that would shape Australian music forever. They moved out of their cramped Melbourne apartments and bought a rundown shack on the outskirts of Petermann. Against the backdrop of Uluru, they started recording music on whatever equipment they could get their hands on - 4 tracks, old army microphones, tin cans on string, etc. After Pot’s friend from Blackpool art school, Bruce Kildouglas, joined their ranks, they were able to release their first single - an ode to James dean entitled “Rebel Man on a Motorbike”. Released under the name “The Philip Spector Experience”. The exposure from this single brought attention to the experience from many artists across the country - John Miner, Filton Hux and Mickey 3 to name a few. The rest is history. Across almost 3 decades, people would come and go and create all sorts of music. The only rule was that anything created had to be released under the TPSE name and as a result, hundreds of LPs, EPs, singles etc. make up their back catalogue. Many lost to time (although the Madrigus Church of Life and spinning sister have been working together to restore the discography) but some not. Notable releases that can be found across various streaming platforms and bandcamp include: Funkun (2024 rerelease); Rebel Man on a motorbike (remix ‘84); Christmas time (Frey Benton turkey pie) (1985); Hooray, Robert Mugabe (1987); 12 Men on a ladder, one falls off (1992); Georgie Twat Sings (1993); The Men LP (2001); Christmas Time (Fray Benton Turkey Pie) - 2001 re-recording (2001). Unfortunately, in 2008, The Experience came to an untimely end because Peterson was killed by stabbing as retribution for a crime that he had been framed for. Any chance of The Experience continuing without him was ruined a few weeks later when Pot was arrested for a crime that he had committed.</p>

<p>Formed with a love of second wave emo, hardcore, and power pop in equal measures, pushbike started playing together in November 2023, and after two member changes, became the lineup seen today in March 2025; George Gravell (guitar, vox), Jamie Dunne (bass, vox), Niall Ivie (guitar, vox) and Tom Grogan (drums, vox). Debut E.P. 'runtime 25.04' released in May 2024, closely followed by a physical release through spinning sister a couple of months later. A loveletter to '90s alternative guitar music, once being described as 'a perfect mix between Teenage Fanclub and Cap'n Jazz'. The opening instrumental 'seven stars' was pressed onto 5" record in limited numbers in August of the same year. It was over a year until the next release, a live version of 'bet you know' with b-side 'i read nothing', a previously unreleased track. The band are a fixture of the Cavern support slot, but have also managed to gigs as far out as Birmingham and Manchester. They are set to release a sophomore E.P. in early 2026.</p>
