<p>spinning sister was founded in early 2024, officially coming into existence on 10th April of the same year with its first event, a covers night at Exeter's Cavern. Since then, we have hosted a number of gigs in Devon, sometimes even daring to venture to the big smoke to play. We've released a handful of tapes and one lathe cut record, three zines, some cigarette cards, a badge, and a t-shirt. Everything we do is in house, I (Niall) drew the logo when I was 16 and make the zine in Microsoft Word. Even down to this website, which has been coded from scratch using Year 9 HTML knowledge. We truly believe in independence.</p>

<p>We want to champion local talent and give opportunities to the masses of great artists of all disciplines that live around Exeter and beyond, whilst also making media that is accessible. Buying a £27.99 copy of 'Romance' from HMV just isn't affordable to the average college student, but a £5 cassette might be. And it might have been your friend from college that made it.</p>

<p>As much as it's our names at the bottom of this page, it goes without saying that spinning sister could not operate without the countless artists that have given their time and work to spi si releases, and we continually thank everyone that has been a part of and that will be a part of our output. It feels like a strange time in the music industry at the moment, but there is strength in knowing being independent can still provide support for smaller artists and grow scenes with likeminded creators. We will continue to do that until the banks run dry.</p>
